# TechConfigs

This is a collection of configurations and Scripts for Automating Sunday A/V processes at [Tenth Presbyterian Church](https://tenth.org).  If you're interested in doing something similar at your church (or somewhere else), you are welcome to borrow anything here in compliance with [the License](LICENSE.md).  

You will, however, almost certainly need to alter some of the scripts to ensure things work in your system.

The instructions we provide our operators (in addition to training) are [in the wiki](https://github.com/TenthPres/techConfigs/wiki).
